# Cyrptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysys

This review looked at several different cryptocurrencies to perform an unsupervised machine learning exercise to determine the principal components of the dataset. The employer, Accountability Accounting, has asked to identify several different classification systems for the coins and a report that talks about what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system

## Results

For this process, the dataset was first cleaned to only include active cryptos that have available coins with label encoding to remove string data and then the dimensions were reduced using the PCA method using three principal components. The PCA data was then clustered using the K-means with a result of four unique clusters based on the data.

## Analysis

Based on the review, the firm can offer reasonably offer up to four clusters for customers to invest in, though further reviews should be done as one of the clusters is very small and may not diversify enough to be a sound investment.
